Function files:

Current files have an initial line containing "version #", where # is the version number.  Older files do not have this line, and are considered version zero.

After the version line (if present) there follows one line of identifiers, counts, and indexes.  It always starts with "brainFunction".  Next come a set of numbers, with no labels, which are:

	agent ID number
    numneurons
    numinputneurons
    numoutputneurons (only in version 1 and later)
    numsynapses
    birthTime
    redStart-redEnd
    greenStart-greenEnd
    blueStart-blueEnd

("birthTime" is the simulation time step at which the agent was introduced into the simulation.)

Then follows the time series of neural activations for all neurons, as follows:

neuronIndex   neuronActivation

0             <value>       \
1             <value>        \_ Values for time step 0 for this agent
...                          /  (time step birthTime in the simulation)
numneurons-1  <value>       /
0             <value>       \
1             <value>        \_ Values for time step 1 for this agent
...                          /  (time step birthTime+1 in the simulation)
numneurons-1  <value>       /

and so on, for the life of the agent.  (Note: The bias neuron activation is not recorded, because it is always 1.0.)

There is a final line that records the final heuristic fitness of the agent at death:  "end fitness = <value>".
