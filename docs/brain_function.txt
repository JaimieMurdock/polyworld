Function files:

There is one line of identifiers, counts,  and indexes.  It always starts with "brainFunction" and the agent ID number.  Next come a set of numbers, with no labels, which are:

numneurons numinputneurons numsynapses birthTime redStart-redEnd greenStart-greenEnd blueStart-blueEnd

("birthTime" is the simulation time step at which the agent was introduced into the simulation.)

Then follows the time series of neural activations for all neurons, as follows:

neuronIndex   neuronActivation

0             <value>       \
1             <value>        \_ Values for time step 0 for this agent
...                          /  (time step birthTime in the simulation)
numneurons-1  <value>       /
0             <value>       \
1             <value>        \_ Values for time step 1 for this agent
...                          /  (time step birthTime+1 in the simulation)
numneurons-1  <value>       /
and so on, for the life of the agent

There is a final line that records the final heuristic fitness of the agent at death:  "end fitness = <value>".
