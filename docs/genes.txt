This document describes the current layout of the genome

Each gene is one byte, and they appear in the following order:

size
strength
maximum speed
ID (green coloration)
mutation rate
number of crossover points
life span
fraction of energy to offspring
number of neurons devoted to red component of vision
number of neurons devoted to green component of vision
number of neurons devoted to blue component of vision
number of internal neuronal groups
number of excitatory neurons in each internal neuronal group
number of inhibitory neurons in each internal neuronal group
initial bias of neurons in each non-input neuronal group
bias learning rate for each non-input neuronal group (not used)
connection density between all pairs of neuronal groups and neuron types
topological distortion between all pairs of neuronal groups and neuron types
learning rate between all pairs of neuronal groups and neuron types
