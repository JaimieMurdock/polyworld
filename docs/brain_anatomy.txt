Anatomy files:

There are two lines of identifiers, counts, and indexes.  The first line always starts with "brain" and the agent ID number.  The remaining values are identified by variableName=value pairs.

fitness - the ad hoc heuristic fitness (not terribly important currently)
numneurons+1 - the number of neurons plus one for the bias neuron (this is
    how many columns and rows there are in the weight matrix)
maxWeight - neuron to neuron weights range from -maxWeight to +maxWeight
maxBias - neuron biases range from -maxBias to +maxBias
redinput - start and end neuron indexes for the red component of vision
greeninput - start and end neuron indexes for the green component of vision
blueinput - start and end neuron indexes for the blue component of vision

Then follows the weight matrix, with the rows indicating the target (post-synaptic) neurons and the columns indicating the source (pre-synaptic) neurons.  The neurons are listed (both row-wise and column-wise) in the following sequence:

Index  Name    Count
  0    random    1
  1    energy    1
       red       fNumRedNeurons
       green     fNumGreenNeurons
       blue      fNumBlueNeurons
       eat       1
       mate      1
       fight     1
       move      1
       turn      1
       light     1
       focus     1
       internal  numneurons-numinputneurons-numOutputNeurons
       bias      1

numinputneurons = fNumRedNeurons + fNumGreenNeurons + fNumBlueNeurons + 2
numOutputNeurons = 7
numneurons and fNum<Color>Neurons counts are determined in brain::grow(),
    from the genetics

The bias and input neurons have no inputs, hence all the zeroes.

In the network, the input and output neurons can have *both* excitatory and inhibitory outgoing connections, but for the anatomical weight matrices they are simply summed to present a single connection strength for a particular target neuron (which is what happens in the neural calculations, so this is technically correct).

Each row/line is terminated with a semicolon.
