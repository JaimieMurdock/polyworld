26 July 2005 -
  Added PwMovieRecord functionality to Polyworld.  Just set new
    "recordMovie" option to 1 in worldfile, to record a highly compressed,
    but lossless movie of the main Polyworld window.
  Added new PwMoviePlayer target and source code to the main Polyworld
    Xcode project.  Select the PwMoviePlayer target to build this stand-
    alone app.
  Added PwMoviePlayer directory and pwmovieplayer.pro file to build the
    movie-player app in qt (without Xcode).  Just 'cd' into the
    PwMoviePlayer directory and type buildit (which just does a qmake
    and make).
